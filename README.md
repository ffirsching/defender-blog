## Ideas
  - Adventure Map - an interactive map of your journeys, with markers showing destinations, routes, and notable experiences. Clicking a marker could bring up blog posts, images, and videos from that location.
  - Gallery 
  - Adventure Timeline ‚Äì A scrolling timeline that visually represents your road trips, with images, blog post links, and timestamps.
  - Defender Mod Log ‚Äì A dedicated section where you document all modifications, upgrades, and customizations with before/after images.
  - Fuel Consumption & Trip Stats Tracker ‚Äì Build a dashboard that calculates distance traveled, fuel efficiency, and cost per trip.
  - Headless CMS for Content Management ‚Äì Use a headless CMS like Strapi, Contentful, or Sanity for managing blog content efficiently.
  - Static Site Generation (SSG) for Speed ‚Äì Use frameworks like Next.js or Astro to ensure fast loading speeds while still keeping a dynamic feel.
  - WebGL or Three.js 3D Model of Your Defender ‚Äì Create a 3D interactive model of your Land Rover that users can rotate, click to learn about modifications, or even simulate different terrains.
  - Comment System with Guestbook ‚Äì Build a custom comment system where visitors can leave notes, or even a guestbook where fellow travelers can share their experiences.
  - Trip Suggestions from Users ‚Äì Let users suggest new routes, camping spots, or must-visit locations, with a voting system.
